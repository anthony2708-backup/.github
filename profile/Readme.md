# Anthony's Backup Vault

Hello, this will be the new way to archive all codebase from my main account ([@anthony2708](https://github.com/anthony2708)), so that I can deploy new code to you via the official repository!

Including in this organization:
- **Projects** repository: The VNUHCM-ITUS repository for all of my codes from my 4-year university journey
- **Tech-savvy** repository: The old repository for all of my other old codes that I am not using currently.

This organization will not be updated regularly in the future - but don't worry, old codes for conservation will be able here when I am upgrading something on my end, so stay tuned!
